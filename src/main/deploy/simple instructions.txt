// This file can be used to pass instructions to the robots via PatternAutonomous.
// Here's an example of this being done:
// robot.addComponent(PatternAutonomous.createFromFile("simple instructions.txt", robot));

// You can use double slashes or a hashtag anywhere in a line and all the text after it on the line will be omitted (commented out)
// If you want to put instructions in here do so with the following syntax (without the hashtags):

#   move 10               // Will move the robot forward '10'
#   wait 15               // Will wait for '15' (should be 30ms)
#   rotate 20             // Will rotate the robot by '20'
#   rotate 10 move -15    // Will rotate the robot by '10' while also moving it backwards by '15'
#   goto 1 1

// Note that there are no units, this is because of how the wpilib api works.
// The units should (but tend not to) represent 2ms, so 10 = 20ms. 
// Which means that "move 10" would (hopefully) mean "move forward for 20ms"

// Although this supports comments and simple instructions it isn't a coding language!!!
// So don't try and do math or make a variable, that would just cause issues.
